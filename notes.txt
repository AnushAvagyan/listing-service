If the server has a route '/:id', it can just res.send the client/dist/index.html file. The browser URL will still contain `id` after the slash.

Then the index.jsx file can parse the id value and pass it as props to the App component. <App listingId={function that gets id} />

The App component sends a GET request to /listings/:id, stores the response data as state.listingData, and then renders child components. (Can this be async? Can I delay rendering the component until after the GET request comes back?)

App
state: {
  listingData: {result of GET request}
}

etc.

SO:
DONE 1. Write new server endpoint that serves index.html to dynamic url
DONE 2. Write another endpoint that sends all features data
DONE 3. Add function to index.jsx that gets the id parameter value and passes it to the App component

DONE: HELP DESK: Why is bundle.js not working when index.html is served from server api??


NEXT: Add 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header to server responses
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:3005/listings/1005' from origin 'https://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
